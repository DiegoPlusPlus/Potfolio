                      <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                      <p>My name is Diego Ortega I am a recent high school graduate who will be attending Contra Costa College in the fall and my major is Mathematical and Scientific Computation. I am a puentista, musician, and coder who spends his free time learning new instruments.</p>

                      <p>Enrolling in a community college was a difficult transition for me. I was stuck debating whether I should accept my admission to USF to study Computer Science or attend community college since I hadn’t been accepted to any of my top schools. Out of fear of what my parents expected of me, I impulsively decided to commit to USF but with time came a sense of regret, stress, and anxiety. It's been more than a month now that I’ve withdrawn my admission from USF and it feels like a hundred pounds have been lifted off my shoulders. I enrolled at my local community college but I still wonder if I made the right decision.</p>
